SOFTWARW AS A MICRO SERVICE(SAAMS)
PROBLEM STATEMENTS:
The need for Research and Development (R&D) has become a necessary tool contributing to a
huge improvement in the various sectors of a businesses in a variety of ways not limited to:
1. Innovation and Competitive Advantage
•Survey enables businesses to develop new products, services, or processes, keeping
them ahead of competitors.
•Innovation helps differentiate offerings, making the business more attractive to
customers.
2. Improved Efficiency and Cost Reduction

7. Compliance and Sustainability
•R&D and Survey can help businesses meet regulatory requirements or environmental
standards through cleaner, safer technologies.
As a great driving tool behind many success stories of several businesses across the world,
many other had not been able to replicate an effective methodologies to handle their R&D and
Surveys as it’s based on accurate data collection via field and virtual means which involves
direct or indirect interaction with people(Online/On field) of different environment.
Deploying field Enumerators/Research in such unfamiliar and unknown environment
sometimes posse a great survival risk and challenge affecting the accuracy of authentic/organic
data collection methodologies.
This project is therefore designed with the rightful technologies and tool as part of the
microservices of the AVAL Ecommerce project to ensure high efficiency and effective R&D data
collection to help position all organizations, businesses and services providers to enhance and
better their day to day quality controls activities and compliance to match up with the
competitive market trends and maximize revenue.
AIM/SOLUTION:
• To ensure a well-designed survey methodologies
• To create effective data collection strategies for effective R&D for businesses and
Organizations
• To create residual income for the unemployed
• To cutdown the risk involved in having Survey Administrator / Data Collector in
unfamiliar environments for research
• To cut down huge cost and Time involved in surveys
• ETC.-------Many more
